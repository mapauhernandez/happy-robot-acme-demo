# Happy Robot ACME Demo

This repository contains the HappyRobot carrier API demo. All application code lives in
[`tiny-api/`](tiny-api/). Change into that directory before running any of the documented
commands:

```bash
cd tiny-api
```

From there you can follow the full setup and usage guide in
[tiny-api/README.md](tiny-api/README.md), including instructions for launching the negotiation
dashboard served at `/dashboard`.
